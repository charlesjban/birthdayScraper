# birthdayScraper
Simple Python program which returns information relating to your birthday.

## SYNOPSIS

birthdayScraper.py

## DESCRIPTION

User will be prompted to enter a date of birth, in the format: dd/mm/yyyy.
This program was created for fun and my own self development. The program works with Python's datetime function and I learned how  to extract information from HTML using Beautiful Soup and a headless browser.
Requires the installation of Selenium webdriver (Google Chrome - chromedriver) and Beautiful soup.
