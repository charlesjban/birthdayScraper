# birthdayScraper
Simple Python program which returns information relating to your birthday.

## SYNOPSIS

birthdayScraper.py

## DESCRIPTION

User will be prompted to enter a date of birth, in the format: dd/mm/yyyy.
This program was created for fun and my own self development. 
The program works with Python's datetime function, providing information on days alive and days till next birthday. 
I learned how  to extract information from HTML using Beautiful Soup and a headless browser and the program returns the name, date of birth and a summary of famous people with the same birthday. 
Enjoy!

Program requires the installation of Selenium webdriver (Google Chrome - chromedriver) and Beautiful soup.
